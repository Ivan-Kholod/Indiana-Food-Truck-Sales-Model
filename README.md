# Indiana-Food-Truck-Sales-Model

-Given the launch of a food truck line, FoodX, we will be running an exciting and interactive promotion on college campuses to attract a massive initial student following.  When placing their order on our fancy new FoodX app they input basic information about their college experience and we predict what they are going to order.  If we donâ€™t get it right they get a 10% discount.

-While the promotion has done a great job of bringing in business our staff has not been great at guessing orders and are not happy with the combined workload of guessing and cooking. Because of this you have been asked to consider implications, solutions and deployment of a mechanism to automatically guess orders, sounds like the perfect job for AI!

-This project will focus on light EDA and attempts to build a model that can guess the orders with high precision given the data that is available.

Data Dictionary:
-"Year" = The current year of college the student is in.
-"University" = The university the student is attending.
-"Major" = The major the student is studying for.
-"Time" = The amount of hours the student works in a week.
-"Order" = What the student ordered (dependent varaible).
