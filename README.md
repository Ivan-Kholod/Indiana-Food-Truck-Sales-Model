# Indiana-Food-Truck-Sales-Model

Given the launch of a food truck line, FoodX, we will be running an exciting and interactive promotion on college campuses to attract a massive initial student following.  When placing their order on our fancy new FoodX app they input basic information about their college experience and we predict what they are going to order.  If we donâ€™t get it right they get a 10% discount.

This project will focus on light EDA and attempts to build a model that can guess the orders with high precision given the data that is available.
